                George Bernard Shaw once said “there is no sincerer love than the love of food.” With eating though,
                comes many underlying social standards, that regardless of the situation, people try to follow. What to
                eat, where to sit, who to sit with, are all questions posed at every meal, and especially in a college
                environment, are questions that are quite important to how a person believes he or she is perceived.
